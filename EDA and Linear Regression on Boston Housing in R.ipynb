As an aspiring data scientist, understanding how to model data like this is of great importance to me. In this kernel, I will use the Boston housing data by Harrison and Rubinfeld (1979) and explore which factors affect the median value of homes. I will perform a linear regression analysis on the same.\n\n### Boston Housing Data\n\nYou can include this data by using the 'MASS' library. The data has following features, medv being the target (dependent) variable:\n\n* crim - per capita crime rate by town\n* zn - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft\n* indus - proportion of non-retail business acres per town\n* chas - Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)\n* nox - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)\n* rm - average number of rooms per dwelling\n* age - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940\n* dis - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres\n* rad - index of accessibility to radial highways\n* tax - full-value property-tax rate per USD 10,000\n* ptratio - pupil-teacher ratio by town\n* black - proportion of blacks by town\n* lstat - percentage of lower status of the population\n* medv - median value of owner-occupied homes in USD 1000â€™s"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## We will structure the code as follows\n1.

Building the model and accuracy analysis\n\n#### How to analyze a model\nIn Linear Regression\n* The Null Hypothesis is that the coefficients associated with the variables are zero. \n* The alternate hypothesis is that the coefficients are not equal to zero (i.e. there exists a relationship between the independent variable in question and the dependent variable).\n* If Pr(>|t|) value has 3 stars, it means that coeffecient is of very high statistical significance. Pr(>|t|) value less than 0.05 is considered as good.\n* Multiple R-squared measures the proportion of the variation in your dependent variable explained by all of your independent variables in the model.\n* Adjusted R-squared measures the proportion of variation explained by only those independent variables that really help in explaining the dependent variable. It penalizes you for adding independent variable that do not help in predicting the dependent variable.\n* If F-statistic is significant then Model is good (higher the value of F-statistic the better).\n* Our key objective is to determine the variable(s) that would give best predictive model.\n\nLet's begin by fitting all the variables."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Fitting Simple Linear regression\n# . is used to fit predictor using all independent variables\nlm.fit1 <- lm(medv~.,data=train)\nsummary(lm.fit1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Iteration 1\n* R-squared value is around 0.76\n* F-statistic value is 90.8\n\n#### Improvements\n* Variables 'age' and 'indus' have very high Pr(>|t|) value and low significance hence removing them could give us a better model.\n* As we noticed in EDA 'lstat' is non-linear and hence can be squared for a better fit."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"lm.fit2 <- lm(medv~.-age-indus+I(lstat^2),data=train)\nsummary(lm.fit2)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Iteration 2\n* R-squared value increased to around 0.81\n* F-statistic value inreased to 128.5\n\n#### Improvements\n* Variable 'zn' has very high Pr(>|t|) value and low significance hence removing it could give us a better model.\n* Interaction between highly significant variables could give us a better model."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"lm.fit3 <- lm(medv~.-indus-age-zn+rm*lstat-black+rm*rad+lstat*rad,data=train)\nsummary(lm.fit3)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Iteration 3\n* R-squared value increased to around 0.86\n* F-statistic value inreased to 185.1\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.
